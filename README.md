# NeosPTTKeybinds

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that can disable or remap the Push to Talk / Mute keybinds on Mouse5, M, and V. Set remapped keys using the numbers from the [Key Code Reference](https://github.com/XDelta/NeosPTTKeybinds/blob/main/KeyCodeReference.txt). Requires Modloader 1.8.0+

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [NeosPTTKeybinds.dll](https://github.com/XDelta/NeosPTTKeybinds/releases/latest/download/NeosPTTKeybinds.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
